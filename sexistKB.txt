As a girl growing up in the 1950’s, all Ellen heard from her mother was
“Don’t be too smart! Boys don’t like that!” She was also told to be
pretty, and demure, and giggly, all in the hopes of landing a husband.
Since Ellen loved to read and play football, and had lots of girlfriends
as well as boyfriends, she didn’t pay too much attention. Ellen’s mother
wasn’t being mean; she was just repeating what every mother of the time
told her daughters. Ellen, nonetheless, attended Smith College and became
a successful businessman – no, businesswoman. Her brother became a
policeman, and her younger sister became a stewardess and traveled the
world. Her brother had three sons, but the girls didn't have any children.
